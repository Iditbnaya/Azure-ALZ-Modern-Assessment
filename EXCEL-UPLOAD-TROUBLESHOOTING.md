# Excel Upload Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview
Comprehensive troubleshooting has been added to the Excel upload process to help diagnose issues when uploads take a long time or fail without errors.

## New Features

### 1. **Detailed Console Logging** 📊
The system now logs every step of the Excel upload process to the browser console (F12):

#### File Reading Phase
- ✅ File name and size
- ✅ Read time in milliseconds
- ✅ Data buffer size
- ✅ Number of sheets detected
- ✅ Sheet names

#### Header Detection Phase
- 🔍 Scanning progress (first 15 rows)
- ✅ Header row location
- 📋 Column headers detected
- 🗺️ Column mapping (which Excel columns map to which fields)

#### Data Processing Phase
- 📊 Total rows to process
- ⏳ Batch processing progress (shows percentage)
- ✅ Items parsed count
- 📊 Items with IDs vs. items without IDs

#### Matching Phase (for items without IDs)
- 🎯 Detected assessment type
- 🗂️ Keyword index building (size and time)
- ⏳ Batch processing progress
- ✅ Matched items count
- ⚠️ Unmatched items (with reason)
- 📊 Average time per item

#### Completion Phase
- 🎉 Total processing time
- ✅ Final item counts
- ✅ Assessment type confirmed

### 2. **Real-time Progress Updates** ⏱️
The upload loader now shows:
- Current operation (Reading Excel file, Matching items, etc.)
- Percentage complete
- Current row / Total rows
- Example: "Reading Excel file... 45% (450/1000 rows)"

### 3. **Timeout Detection** ⏰
- Automatically detects if Excel parsing takes longer than 60 seconds
- Shows clear error message: "Excel file parsing timed out"
- Helps identify corrupted or extremely large files

### 4. **Diagnostic Panel** 🐛
A new diagnostic panel is available in the upload loader:

#### How to Access:
1. Click "Upload Assessment" button
2. Select an Excel file
3. While processing, click "Show Diagnostic Logs" button
4. View real-time logs in the panel

#### What It Shows:
- Timestamped log entries
- INFO, WARN, and ERROR level messages
- JSON formatted data for complex objects
- Last 100 log entries (auto-scrolling to latest)

### 5. **Performance Metrics** 📈
Every operation is timed and logged:
- File read time
- Sheet parsing time
- Data conversion time
- Matching time (if applicable)
- Total processing time
- Average time per item for matching

### 6. **Error Context** 🔍
When errors occur, you now get:
- Exact error message
- Stack trace (in console)
- Sample data that failed (for debugging)
- Specific operation that failed

## How to Use

### Basic Troubleshooting
1. **Open Browser Console** (F12 or Right-click → Inspect → Console tab)
2. **Upload your Excel file**
3. **Watch the console logs** in real-time
4. **Look for:**
   - ❌ Red error messages
   - ⚠️ Yellow warning messages
   - 📊 Processing statistics

### Using the Diagnostic Panel
1. Click "Upload Assessment"
2. Select your Excel file
3. Click "Show Diagnostic Logs" button
4. Monitor progress in the panel
5. Copy logs if you need to report an issue

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Could not find header row"
**Symptoms:**
- Upload fails immediately
- Console shows: "❌ Header row not found"

**Solution:**
- Check first 5 rows in console output
- Ensure headers include terms like: id, guid, category, text, status, severity
- Headers should be in rows 1-15

#### Issue: "Excel file parsing timed out"
**Symptoms:**
- Upload stops after 60 seconds
- Timeout error message

**Solution:**
- File may be too large (>10MB)
- File may be corrupted
- Try opening in Excel and saving a copy
- Consider splitting into smaller files

#### Issue: "No valid assessment items found"
**Symptoms:**
- File parses but no items extracted
- Console shows: "❌ No valid items found"

**Solution:**
- Check column mapping in console
- Ensure data rows have required fields (id, text/recommendation)
- Check for empty rows

#### Issue: Slow matching phase
**Symptoms:**
- "Matching items..." progress stays at same percentage
- Takes several minutes

**Solution:**
- This is normal for files with many items without IDs
- Check console for matching progress logs
- Each batch shows progress percentage
- If stuck >5 minutes, refresh page and try again

#### Issue: Items not matching to checklist
**Symptoms:**
- Console shows "⚠️ Could not match item"
- Some items missing after upload

**Solution:**
- Items need text similarity threshold >30%
- Check unmatched item text in console
- Ensure recommendation text is detailed
- Consider manually adding IDs to Excel file before upload

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Upload Times

| File Size | Rows | Items | Expected Time |
|-----------|------|-------|---------------|
| < 100KB   | < 100 | < 50 | 1-3 seconds |
| 100-500KB | 100-500 | 50-250 | 3-10 seconds |
| 500KB-2MB | 500-2000 | 250-1000 | 10-30 seconds |
| 2MB-5MB   | 2000-5000 | 1000-2500 | 30-60 seconds |
| > 5MB     | > 5000 | > 2500 | 60+ seconds |

### Factors Affecting Speed
- **Items without IDs**: Requires text matching (slower)
- **File format**: .xlsx is faster than .xls
- **Browser**: Chrome/Edge typically fastest
- **Computer specs**: CPU speed matters for matching
- **Network**: Not a factor (all processing is local)

## Advanced Debugging

### Export Diagnostic Logs
To save logs for reporting issues:

```javascript
// In browser console:
copy(JSON.stringify(window.app.diagnosticLogs, null, 2))
```

Then paste into a text file.

### Check Processing Statistics
After upload completes, check console for summary:

```
🎉 Excel parsing complete: {
  totalRows: 1000,
  itemsFound: 250,
  conversionTime: "5234ms",
  totalTime: "8912ms",
  assessmentType: "alz"
}
```

### Monitor Memory Usage
For very large files:
1. Open Chrome Task Manager (Shift+Esc)
2. Watch "Memory footprint" during upload
3. If >500MB, file may be too large

### Performance Profiling
For detailed analysis:
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Performance tab
3. Click Record
4. Upload file
5. Stop recording
6. Analyze flame graph for bottlenecks

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter problems, please provide:

1. **Browser Console Logs** (copy entire log)
2. **File Details**:
   - File size
   - Number of rows
   - Excel version
3. **Error Messages** (exact text)
4. **Processing Times** (from console logs)
5. **Browser & Version** (Chrome 120, Edge 119, etc.)
6. **Steps to Reproduce**

## Recent Improvements

### Version 2.0 (Current)
- ✅ Keyword-based indexing (10-100x faster matching)
- ✅ Batch processing with 1ms delays
- ✅ Real-time progress indicators
- ✅ Comprehensive logging at every step

- Reduces complexity from O(n²) to O(n)
- Uses words >4 characters as keywords
- Takes first 10 keywords per item

### Batch Processing
- Processes 100 rows per batch during parsing
- Processes 50 items per batch during matching
- 1ms delay between parse batches
- 5ms delay between match batches
- Allows UI to remain responsive

### Similarity Threshold
- Minimum 30% word overlap required for match
- Uses word-based Jaccard similarity
- Filters words >3 characters
- Case-insensitive comparison

## Tips for Faster Uploads

1. **Pre-add IDs**: Include item IDs in Excel to skip matching
2. **Use .xlsx**: Modern format is faster than .xls
3. **Close other tabs**: Free up browser memory
4. **Use Chrome/Edge**: Generally fastest browsers
5. **Remove extra sheets**: Keep only assessment data sheet
6. **Clean headers**: Use standard column names (id, category, text, status)

## FAQ

**Q: Why does it take longer the first time?**
A: First upload loads the checklist for matching. Subsequent uploads are faster.

**Q: Can I cancel during upload?**
A: Refresh the page to cancel. Data is not saved until complete.

**Q: What happens if I close the browser?**
A: Upload will stop. Restart the process after reopening.

**Q: Is my data sent to a server?**
A: No. All processing happens in your browser locally.

**Q: Why do some items not match?**
A: Text similarity must be >30%. Add more detailed text or IDs in Excel.

**Q: Can I upload multiple files?**
A: Upload one at a time. Last upload replaces previous data.
